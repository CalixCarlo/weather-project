        <Accordion.Header>Does this My Weather App is Accurate?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Not Really, but a seven-day forecast can accurately predict the weather 
          about 80 percent of the time and a five-day forecast can accurately predict 
          the weather approximately 90 percent of the time. However, a 10-day—or 
          longer—forecast is only right about half the time.
